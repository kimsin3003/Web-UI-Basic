    <p>It's time-consuming to cut through the ocean of mediocre web fonts to find the real gems that punch above their (zero) price tag. With this in mind, we've rounded up the greatest free web fonts from around the web to get you started.</p>

    <p>There are various methods to source and license web fonts, including subscription-based models such as Typekit, Fontdeck and Fontspring, which boast libraries of quality typefaces and are becoming increasingly popular with professional designers. If you're on a tight budget, however, or are just looking to experiment on a smaller project, there are plenty of good web fonts available at no cost if you know where to look.</p>

    <p>Sites such as Font Squirrel are helpful, not to mention the free-to-use Google Web Fonts service and Adobe Edge Web Fonts. Powered by Typekit, this supplements the GWF library with several of Adobe's own open source web fonts and integrates neatly with Edge and Muse. But here is our selection of the best around.</p>

    <p>Oh, and you should also read: rules for using web fonts that some designers forget!</p>
